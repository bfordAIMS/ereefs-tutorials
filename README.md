## User overview

This repository holds the source files for the AIMS Knowledge Systems eReefs tutorials hosted as [](bfordAIMS.github.io/ereefs-tutorials). 

Currently the site holds a single tutorial for plotting eReefs time series data in `R`. However, in time we hope to include a range of tutorials in both `R` and `python`. If you wish to see a tutorial on a specific topic you can add a request using the Github Issues feature, though please note that the development of subsequent tutorials is dependent on the time availability of AIMS staff.
